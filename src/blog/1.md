## Artist's life
He was a formative influence on Dutch Golden Age painting and later painting in general in his innovative choices of subject matter, as one of the first generation of artists to grow up when religious subjects had ceased to be the natural subject matter of painting. He also painted no portraits, the other mainstay of Netherlandish art.

As well as looking forwards, his art reinvigorates medieval subjects such as marginal drolleries of ordinary life in illuminated manuscripts, and the calendar scenes of agricultural labours set in landscape backgrounds, and puts these on a much larger scale than before, and in the expensive medium of oil painting. He does the same with the fantastic and anarchic world developed in Renaissance prints and book illustrations.

Netherlandish Proverbs (*Dutch: Nederlandse Spreekwoorden; also called Flemish Proverbs, The Blue Cloak or The Topsy Turvy World*) depicts a scene in which humans and, to a lesser extent, animals and objects, offer literal illustrations of Dutch-language proverbs and idioms.

Running themes in Bruegel's paintings that appear in Netherlandish Proverbs are the absurdity, wickedness and foolishness of humans. Its original title, **The Blue Cloak or The Folly of the World**, indicates that Bruegel's intent was not just to illustrate proverbs, but rather to catalog human folly. Many of the people depicted show the characteristic blank features that Bruegel used to portray fools.

Critics have praised the composition for its ordered portrayal and integrated scene. There are approximately **112 identifiable proverbs and idioms in the scene**, although Bruegel may have included others which cannot be determined because of the language change. Some of those incorporated in the painting are still in popular use, for instance *"Swimming against the tide"*, *"Banging one's head against a brick wall"* and *"Armed to the teeth"*. Many more have faded from use, which makes analysis of the painting harder. *"Having one's roof tiled with tarts"*, for example, which meant to have an abundance of everything and was an image Bruegel would later feature in his painting of the idyllic Land of Cockaigne (1567)

### The Hunters in the Snow
**Artist**      Pieter Bruegel the Elder

**Year**        1565

**Medium**      Oil-on-panel

**Dimensions**	117 cm × 162 cm (46 in × 63 in)

**Location**	Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna

The painting shows a wintry scene in which three hunters are returning from an expedition accompanied by their dogs. By appearances the outing was not successful; the hunters appear to trudge wearily, and the dogs appear downtrodden and miserable. One man carries the "meager corpse of a fox" illustrating the paucity of the hunt. In front of the hunters in the snow are the footprints of a rabbit or hare—which has escaped or been missed by the hunters. The overall visual impression is one of a calm, cold, overcast day; the colors are muted whites and grays, the trees are bare of leaves, and wood smoke hangs in the air. Several adults and a child prepare food at an inn with an outside fire. Of interest are the jagged mountain peaks which do not exist in Belgium or Holland.

### The Peasant Wedding
**Artist**      Pieter Bruegel the Elder

**Year**        1567

**Medium**      Oil-on-panel

**Dimensions**	114 cm × 164 cm (45 in × 65 in)

**Location**	Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna

![Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painting 'The Peasant Wedding'](../../img/01c-brueghel-peasant-wedding.jpg)

Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed painting peasants and different aspects of their lives in so many of his paintings that he has been called *Peasant-Bruegel*, but he was an intellectual, and many of his paintings have a symbolic meaning as well as a moral aspect.

The bride is in front of the green textile wall-hanging, with a paper-crown hung above her head. She is also wearing a crown on her head, and she is sitting passively, not participating in the eating or drinking taking place around her. The bridegroom is not immediately obvious. The feast is in a barn in the summertime; two sheaves of grain with a rake recalls the work that harvesting involves, and the hard life peasants have. The plates are carried on a door off its hinges. The main food was bread, porridge and soup. Other features of the scene include two pipers playing the pijpzak, an unbreeched boy in the foreground licking a plate, a wealthy man at the far right talking to a Franciscan monk, a dog emerging from under the table to feed off pieces of bread on the bench, and a mysterious extra foot seen under the load of dishes being carried by the two men in the right foreground. The scene is claimed to depict an accurate portrayal of the 16th-century way of celebrating a peasant wedding.
