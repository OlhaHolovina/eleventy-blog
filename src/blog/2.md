## Artist's life
John Singer Sargent was an American expatriate artist, considered the *"leading portrait painter of his generation"* for his evocations of Edwardian-era luxury. He created roughly **900 oil paintings** and more than **2,000 watercolors**, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings. His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.

His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism. In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air.

The painting depicts two small children dressed in white who are lighting paper lanterns as day turns to evening; they are in a garden strewn with pink roses, accents of yellow carnations and tall white lilies *(possibly the Japanese mountain lily, Lilium auratum)* behind them. The painting is dominated by green foliage, with no horizon or other horizontal line to give a sense of depth. The viewer seems to be on a level with the children but also looking down on them. The two subjects of the painting are the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard – a friend of Sargent's.

**El Jaleo** is a large painting by John Singer Sargent, depicting a Spanish Gypsy dancer performing to the accompaniment of musicians. Painted in 1882, it currently hangs in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

The painting was inspired by a five-month trip Sargent made through Spain and North Africa in 1879, which also yielded a smaller oil painting, The Spanish Dance. Chronologically and thematically, the painting is related to a series of works Sargent painted during a subsequent stay in Venice; these, too, include dramatic light effects, exotic models, and restrained coloring. Impressed by the costumes and theatrical manner of **Gypsy** dance, the artist returned to Paris and began work on a large canvas whose scale suggested a performing stage. The name *El Jaleo* refers to both the broad meaning of jaleo, a ruckus, as well as the specific dance known as *jaleo de jerez*.

Sargent planned the composition of El Jaleo for at least a year. The painting was preceded by a series of preliminary studies, focusing particularly on the dancer's stylized posture. The result of thorough preparation, El Jaleo is characterized by an assured and rapid handling, and may have been completed in no more than a few days.

### Lady Agnew of Lochnaw
**Artist**      John Singer Sargent

**Year**        1892

**Medium**      Oil on canvas

**Dimensions**	127 cm × 101 cm (50 in × 40 in)

**Location**	Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh

Lady Agnew is seated in an 18th-century French Bergère and, according to art historian Richard Ormond, the back of the chair is used as a "curving, supporting space to contain the figure, creating a distinctive, languid elegance". Sargent pictured her in a three-quarter length pose, dressed in a white gown with a silk mauve sash as an accessory round her waist.

The portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, in 1893 and may have been influential in the artist's acceptance as an associate of the Academy the following January. According to an unattributed article in **The Times** dated 29 April 1893, the portrait was *"not only a triumph of technique but the finest example of portraiture, in the literal sense of the word, that has been seen here for a long time..."*
